## Development Guidelines

### CSS Variables
All design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) are defined as CSS variables in `:root`. **Always use these variables** instead of hardcoding hex values or font names to maintain consistency.

```css
/* Example Usage */
.cta-banner {
  background-color: var(--color-accent);
  font-family: var(--font-family-heading);
}
```

### Responsive Design
The site is designed to be fully responsive. Media queries are used to adjust layouts for tablet and mobile devices. All new components should be tested across a range of screen sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern code editor (e.g., VS Code, Cursor).
*   The **Live Server** extension for VS Code/Cursor is highly recommended for local development.

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ipave-website
    ```
3.  **Launch the development server:**
    *   Right-click on the `index.html` file in your editor.
    *   Select "Open with Live Server".
    *   This will open the site in your default browser and automatically reload the page whenever you save a file.

## Deployment

The site is configured for continuous deployment on **Cloudflare Pages**. Any push to the `main` branch of the Git repository will automatically trigger a new build and deploy the changes to the live website.

## Service Pages Development Plan

### Phase 1: Services Overview Page (`/services/index.html`)

- Schema markup for Service schema type

### Phase 2: Individual Service Pages
**Residential Driveways (`/services/residential-driveways.html`)**
- Hero with service-specific imagery
- Detailed service description and benefits
- Process explanation (3-4 steps)
- Before/after gallery
- FAQ section
- Related services cross-links
- Quote request CTA

**Commercial Paving (`/services/commercial-paving.html`)**

### Phase 3: Cross-Linking Strategy for SEO
**Homepage Integration:**
- Update "Our Services" section to link to `/services/`

- Include service highlights with "Learn More" links

**Navigation Updates:**
- Main navigation includes "Services" dropdown

- Breadcrumb navigation on all service pages

**Internal Linking Structure:**
```
Homepage â†’ Services Overview â†’ Individual Service Pages
Individual Service Pages â†’ Related Services (cross-links)
All Pages â†’ Contact/Quote Request Forms
```

### Phase 4: Content Optimization
**Each Service Page Includes:**
- Unique, detailed content (800-1200 words minimum)
- Service-specific keywords and long-tail phrases
- Local SEO elements (Christchurch, Canterbury references)
- Customer testimonials and case studies
- Clear calls-to-action
- Contact information and quote request forms

**Technical SEO Requirements:**

- Fast loading times (maintain PageSpeed scores)
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Phase 5: Performance & Maintenance
**Performance Considerations:**
- Optimize images for each service page

- Maintain critical CSS inlining strategy

**Content Maintenance:**
- Regular content updates and seasonal promotions
- Customer feedback integration
- Portfolio updates and new project showcases
- Service area expansion updates

## Important Considerations

### Contact Forms

*   The contact and footer forms are static HTML elements.
*   They submit to **Formspree** to process the data and send an email notification.
*   The `action` attribute of each `<form>` tag must be set to the correct Formspree endpoint URL.

### Asset Management

*   **Images:** Place all images in the `/assets/images/` folder. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `residential-driveway-paving.jpg`). Use SVGs for logos and icons whenever possible.
*   **Fonts:** All fonts are self-hosted in `/assets/fonts/`. Ensure you have the correct `.woff2` files for any new font styles or weights.

### SEO & Content Strategy

*   **Keywords:** Each service page should target specific, relevant keywords while maintaining natural readability.
*   **Internal Linking:** Implement strategic internal linking between related services and the homepage.
*   **Content Updates:** Regular content updates help maintain search engine relevance and user engagement.
*   **Local SEO:** Include location-specific information and references to service areas.

## Redirect Strategy for Legacy Pages

### Current Sitemap Analysis
The existing `sitemap.xml` currently only references the homepage. However, if there are legacy WordPress URLs or other existing pages that need to be maintained, proper redirects must be implemented.

### Redirect Implementation for Cloudflare Pages

**Option 1: Cloudflare Pages Redirects (Recommended)**
Create a `_redirects` file in the root directory:
```
# Legacy page redirects
/old-page /new-page 301
/old-service /services/new-service 301
/blog/post-name /about/projects 301

# Catch-all for old WordPress structure
/wp-content/* / 301
/wp-admin/* / 301
/wp-includes/* / 301

# Redirect old service URLs to new service pages
/services/driveway-paving /services/residential-driveways 301
/services/commercial-concrete /services/commercial-paving 301
/services/concrete-maintenance /services/concrete-repair 301
```

**Option 2: HTML Meta Refresh Redirects**
For pages that can't use Cloudflare redirects, implement meta refresh:
```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/new-page-url">
```

### Redirect Types and SEO Impact

**301 Redirects (Permanent)**
- Use for permanently moved content
- Passes 90-99% of SEO value
- Ideal for service page migrations
- Update internal links accordingly

**302 Redirects (Temporary)**
- Use for temporary content moves
- Minimal SEO value transfer
- Good for maintenance periods
- Update to 301 when permanent

### Redirect Audit Process

1. **Identify Legacy URLs:**
   - Export existing sitemap from WordPress
   - Check Google Search Console for indexed URLs
   - Review analytics for incoming traffic sources

2. **Map Redirect Destinations:**
   - Legacy service pages â†’ New service pages
   - Blog posts â†’ Relevant service pages or about section
   - Category pages â†’ Services overview page

3. **Implement Redirects:**
   - Create `_redirects` file for Cloudflare Pages
   - Test redirects locally before deployment
   - Monitor 404 errors after deployment

4. **Update Internal Links:**
   - Scan existing content for old URLs
   - Update all internal references
   - Ensure new service pages are properly linked

### SEO Considerations for Redirects

*   **Maintain Link Equity:** Proper redirects preserve SEO value from old pages
*   **User Experience:** Redirects prevent broken links and improve navigation
*   **Search Engine Crawling:** Clear redirect paths help search engines understand site structure
*   **Local SEO:** Preserve local business citations and directory listings
*   **Analytics Continuity:** Maintain tracking of user journeys and conversion paths

### Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **Regular 404 Monitoring:** Check for new broken links after redirect implementation
*   **Search Console Updates:** Monitor redirect performance in Google Search Console
*   **User Feedback:** Track user complaints about broken links or navigation issues
*   **Performance Impact:** Ensure redirects don't significantly impact page load times
