## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Optimization Journey

### Initial Challenges
- **CLS Score**: Started at 0.151 (Poor)
- **Speed Index**: Started at 3.5s (Slow)
- **Element Render Delay**: Started at 2,260ms (Very Slow)
- **Forced Reflows**: 37ms (Performance Impact)

### Optimization Strategy Implemented

#### 1. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Fixes**
- **Explicit Logo Dimensions**: Set `width: 250px; height: 60px` with `object-fit: contain`
- **Layout Containment**: Applied `contain: layout` strategically to prevent layout shifts
- **Min-Height Constraints**: Added stable dimensions to headings and hero sections
- **Font Loading Strategy**: Used `font-display: block` to prevent font-related shifts
- **Device-Specific Optimizations**: Different constraints for mobile vs desktop layouts

#### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- **System Fonts for Critical Elements**: Used `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont` for immediate rendering
- **Font Preloading**: Preloaded critical fonts with `crossorigin` attribute
- **JavaScript Optimization**: Eliminated `IntersectionObserver` and `requestAnimationFrame` that caused forced reflows
- **Image Optimization**: Implemented responsive images with WebP format
- **Critical CSS**: Moved above-the-fold styles to the top of the document

#### 3. **Technical Implementation Details**

**Layout Stability:**
```css
/* Critical above-the-fold styles */
.hero-text h1 {
    font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3rem);
    line-height: 1.1;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: #FDE906;
    min-height: 1.1em;
    contain: layout;
}

/* Explicit logo dimensions */
.site-logo img { 
    width: 250px; 
    height: 60px; 
    object-fit: contain; 
}

/* Layout containment */
.hero-text { 
    min-height: 300px; 
    display: flex; 
    flex-direction: column; 
    justify-content: center; 
    contain: layout; 
}
```

**Font Loading Strategy:**
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Montserrat';
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-display: block; /* Prevents layout shifts */
    src: url('assets/fonts/montserrat-v30-latin-700.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

**JavaScript Optimization:**
```javascript
// Minimal script for optimal performance
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Only apply to images that need it (not critical above-the-fold images)
    const images = document.querySelectorAll('img:not(.site-logo img)');
    images.forEach(img => {
        img.addEventListener('load', function() {
            this.style.opacity = '1';
        });
        img.style.opacity = '0.8';
        img.style.transition = 'opacity 0.2s ease';
    });
});
```

## Development Guidelines

### CSS Variables
All design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) are defined as CSS variables in `:root`. **Always use these variables** instead of hardcoding hex values or font names to maintain consistency.

```css
/* Example Usage */
.cta-banner {
  background-color: var(--color-accent);
  font-family: var(--font-family-heading);
}
```

### Responsive Design
The site is designed to be fully responsive. Media queries are used to adjust layouts for tablet and mobile devices. All new components should be tested across a range of screen sizes.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern code editor (e.g., VS Code, Cursor).
*   The **Live Server** extension for VS Code/Cursor is highly recommended for local development.

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ipave-website
    ```
3.  **Launch the development server:**
    *   Right-click on the `index.html` file in your editor.
    *   Select "Open with Live Server".
    *   This will open the site in your default browser and automatically reload the page whenever you save a file.

## Deployment

The site is configured for continuous deployment on **Cloudflare Pages**. Any push to the `main` branch of the Git repository will automatically trigger a new build and deploy the changes to the live website.

## Important Considerations

### Contact Forms

*   The contact and footer forms are static HTML elements.
*   They submit to **Formspree** to process the data and send an email notification.
*   The `action` attribute of each `<form>` tag must be set to the correct Formspree endpoint URL.

### Asset Management

*   **Images:** Place all images in the `/assets/images/` folder. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `residential-driveway-paving.jpg`). Use SVGs for logos and icons whenever possible.
*   **Fonts:** All fonts are self-hosted in `/assets/fonts/`. Ensure you have the correct `.woff2` files for any new font styles or weights.

### Image Optimization with Squoosh - Hybrid Approach

For optimal performance AND quality, we use a hybrid approach: WebP for mobile/tablet (speed) and PNG for desktop (maximum quality).

#### Current Image: `paved-driveway.jpg`
**Required sizes for responsive design (based on PageSpeed Insights):**

1. **Mobile (â‰¤600px):** `paved-driveway-mobile.webp`
   - Dimensions: 362x242px (actual display size)
   - Format: WebP
   - Quality: 90-95% (for sharpness)
   - Target file size: <25KB
   - **Savings:** 114.6KB (from 139.6KB)

2. **Tablet (601-900px):** `paved-driveway-tablet.webp`
   - Dimensions: 500x334px (intermediate size)
   - Format: WebP
   - Quality: 90-95% (for sharpness)
   - Target file size: <40KB
   - **Savings:** 99.6KB (from 139.6KB)

3. **Desktop (â‰¥901px):** `paved-driveway-desktop.webp`
   - Dimensions: 800x534px (actual display size per PageSpeed)
   - Format: WebP
   - Quality: 85-90% (excellent quality, much smaller than lossless)
   - Target file size: <60KB
   - **Savings:** 79.6KB (from 139.6KB)

#### Image Optimization Tools:

**Option 1: Paint.NET (Recommended)**
- **File Format:** Save as WebP
- **Quality Settings:** 
  - Mobile: 90-95% quality
  - Tablet: 90-95% quality  
  - Desktop: 85-90% quality
- **Resize:** Use Image â†’ Resize to exact dimensions
- **Save Settings:** Enable "Lossy" compression (not lossless)

**Option 2: Squoosh (Alternative)**
- **For Mobile/Tablet (WebP):**
  - **Compression:** WebP
  - **Quality:** 90-95% (for sharpness)
  - **Resize:** Enable, maintain aspect ratio
  - **Metadata:** Remove unnecessary metadata
  - **Advanced:** Enable "Sharp YUV" if available

- **For Desktop (WebP):**
  - **Compression:** WebP
  - **Quality:** 85-90% (excellent quality, much smaller than lossless)
  - **Resize:** Enable, maintain aspect ratio
  - **Metadata:** Remove unnecessary metadata
  - **Advanced:** Enable "Sharp YUV" if available

#### Paint.NET Workflow:

1. **Open your original image** in Paint.NET
2. **Resize for each target size:**
   - **Mobile:** Image â†’ Resize â†’ 362 Ã— 242 pixels
   - **Tablet:** Image â†’ Resize â†’ 500 Ã— 334 pixels  
   - **Desktop:** Image â†’ Resize â†’ 800 Ã— 534 pixels
3. **Save as WebP:** File â†’ Save As â†’ WebP format
4. **Quality settings:**
   - **Mobile/Tablet:** 90-95% quality (sharp, fast)
   - **Desktop:** 85-90% quality (excellent, optimized)
5. **Ensure "Lossy" is enabled** (not lossless)
6. **Fallback:** Keep original `paved-driveway.jpg` for browsers without WebP support

#### Benefits:
- **Mobile users:** Download only 25KB instead of 139.6KB (82% reduction)
- **Tablet users:** Download only 40KB instead of 139.6KB (71% reduction)
- **Desktop users:** Download only 60KB instead of 139.6KB (57% reduction) + **excellent quality**

- **Best of both worlds:** Speed on mobile, excellent quality on desktop
- **Improved LCP:** Faster image loading on all devices
- **Better Core Web Vitals:** Reduced CLS and improved performance scores
- **User satisfaction:** All users get fast-loading, high-quality images

### SEO & Content Strategy

*   **Keywords:** Each service page should target specific, relevant keywords while maintaining natural readability.
*   **Internal Linking:** Implement strategic internal linking between related services and the homepage.
*   **Content Updates:** Regular content updates help maintain search engine relevance and user engagement.
*   **Local SEO:** Include location-specific information and references to service areas.

## Redirect Strategy for Legacy Pages

### Current Sitemap Analysis
The existing `sitemap.xml` currently only references the homepage. However, if there are legacy WordPress URLs or other existing pages that need to be maintained, proper redirects must be implemented.

### Redirect Implementation for Cloudflare Pages

**Option 1: Cloudflare Pages Redirects (Recommended)**
Create a `_redirects` file in the root directory:
```
# Legacy page redirects
/old-page /new-page 301
/old-service /services/new-service 301
/blog/post-name /about/projects 301

# Catch-all for old WordPress structure
/wp-content/* / 301
/wp-admin/* / 301
/wp-includes/* / 301

# Redirect old service URLs to new service pages
/services/driveway-paving /services/residential-driveways 301
/services/commercial-concrete /services/commercial-paving 301
/services/concrete-maintenance /services/concrete-repair 301
```

**Option 2: HTML Meta Refresh Redirects**
For pages that can't use Cloudflare redirects, implement meta refresh:
```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/new-page-url">
```

### Redirect Types and SEO Impact

**301 Redirects (Permanent)**
- Use for permanently moved content
- Passes 90-99% of SEO value
- Ideal for service page migrations
- Update internal links accordingly

**302 Redirects (Temporary)**
- Use for temporary content moves
- Minimal SEO value transfer
- Good for maintenance periods
- Update to 301 when permanent

### Redirect Audit Process

1. **Identify Legacy URLs:**
   - Export existing sitemap from WordPress
   - Check Google Search Console for indexed URLs
   - Review analytics for incoming traffic sources

2. **Map Redirect Destinations:**
   - Legacy service pages â†’ New service pages
   - Blog posts â†’ Relevant service pages or about section
   - Category pages â†’ Services overview page

3. **Implement Redirects:**
   - Create `_redirects` file for Cloudflare Pages
   - Test redirects locally before deployment
   - Monitor 404 errors after deployment

4. **Update Internal Links:**
   - Scan existing content for old URLs
   - Update all internal references
   - Ensure new service pages are properly linked

### SEO Considerations for Redirects

*   **Maintain Link Equity:** Proper redirects preserve SEO value from old pages
*   **User Experience:** Redirects prevent broken links and improve navigation
*   **Search Engine Crawling:** Clear redirect paths help search engines understand site structure
*   **Local SEO:** Preserve local business citations and directory listings
*   **Analytics Continuity:** Maintain tracking of user journeys and conversion paths

### Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **Regular 404 Monitoring:** Check for new broken links after redirect implementation
*   **Search Console Updates:** Monitor redirect performance in Google Search Console
*   **User Feedback:** Track user complaints about broken links or navigation issues
*   **Performance Impact:** Ensure redirects don't significantly impact page load times

- **Purpose:** Show, don't just tell - demonstrate expertise

#### Gallery of Our Work
- **Content:** 5-10 high-quality images of local projects using that specific finish
- **Purpose:** Most powerful selling tool - visual proof of capability
- **SEO:** Optimize alt text with location and finish-specific keywords

#### Customisation Options
- **Content:** Discuss different types of stone, colours, and sealant options
- **Purpose:** Showcase expertise and attention to detail
- **SEO:** Target long-tail keywords like "exposed aggregate colours Christchurch"

#### Clear Call-to-Action
- **Format:** "Ready to transform your [area] with [finish]? Contact us for a free, no-obligation quote."
- **Purpose:** Convert interest into action

### Step 3: SEO Strategy for Each Finish Page

- **Primary:** "[finish type] concrete Christchurch"
- **Secondary:** "[finish type] driveway cost", "[finish type] patio", "[finish type] pool surround"
- **Long-tail:** "best [finish type] contractor Christchurch", "[finish type] vs [alternative] cost"
